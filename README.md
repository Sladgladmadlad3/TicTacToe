# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Project Description
This is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe game** implemented in Java. The game features a 3x3 game board where two players take turns marking a space on the board with `X` or `O`. The goal is to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win.

## Features
- A fully functional 3x3 game board.
- Two-player mode (Player X vs. Player O).
- Win condition detection for rows, columns, and diagonals.
- Draw detection when the board is full with no winner.

## How to Play
1. Player X starts by choosing an available spot on the board.
2. Player O follows by selecting their spot.
3. The game checks for a winner after each move.
4. If all spots are filled and no player wins, the game ends in a draw.
